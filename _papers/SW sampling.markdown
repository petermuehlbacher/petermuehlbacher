abstract: 'We consider quantum spins with \(S\geq1\), and two-body interactions with \(O(2S+1)\) symmetry. We discuss the ground state phase diagram of the one-dimensional system. We give a rigorous proof of dimerization for an open region of the phase diagram, for \(S\) sufficiently large. We also prove the existence of a gap for excitations.'
