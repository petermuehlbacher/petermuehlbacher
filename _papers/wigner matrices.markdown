abstract: 'We consider a Wigner-type ensemble, i.e. large hermitian \(N\times\) random matrices \(H=H^*\) with centered independent entries and with a general matrix of variances \(S_{xy}=\mathbb E|H_{xy}|^2\). The norm of \(H\) is asymptotically given by the maximum of the support of the self-consistent density of states. We establish a bound on this maximum in terms of norms of powers of \(S\) that substantially improves the earlier bound \(2\|S\|_\infty^{1/2}\) given in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05098">[arXiv:1506.05098]</a>. The key element of the proof is an effective Markov chain approximation for the contributions of the weighted Dyck paths appearing in the iterative solution of the corresponding Dyson equation.
