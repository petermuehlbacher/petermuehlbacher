# Information aggegration

# Combinatorial markets
## What are they?
* http://blog.oddhead.com/2008/12/22/what-is-and-what-good-is-a-combinatorial-prediction-market/
* 

## How do they help?
* discrete time helps people who can't be awake 24/7 updating immediately on everything
* need to balance 
  * using markets to gain insight
  * keeping forecasters from just copying the median (this can either be done by discretising time or real money markets where people without new information (=an edge) just don't trade)
