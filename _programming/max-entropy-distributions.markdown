Most up-to-date notes and the Python script can be found in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tf-Ywh5HZIXxKhXCTkhveJRV-n_9YoXm). If you want to contribute, please shoot me a message and/or send a pull request [on Github](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/maxentropy). The case of min-cross-entropy distributions is covered as well.
